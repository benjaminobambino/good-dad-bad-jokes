### ***Description***
#### "Good Dad Bad Jokes" is a browser-based, full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) app that does exactly what a good dad should: tell bad jokes. Upon launch, users can immediately enjoy jokes being pulled from the back-end database. Users who sign up can "like" their favorite jokes and contribute their own jokes to the database.
#### Jokes and user info are stored in the back-end database and updated by the front-end user interface through axios calls.

#### The project will be deployed and able to be viewed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (Pending).
#### Once launched, create a user account to add your own jokes, like jokes, and flag jokes. Otherwise, just open the app and enjoy the jokes!
