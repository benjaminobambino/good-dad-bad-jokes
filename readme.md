### ***Description***
#### "Good Dad Bad Jokes" will be a browser-based, fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) app that does exactly what a good dad should: tell bad jokes. Users will be able to launch and immediately enjoy jokes being pulled from the backend database. Users who sign up will be able to "like" their favorite jokes, see the jokes they've "liked," and contribute their own jokes to the database.
#### Jokes and user info will be stored in the backend database and updated through the frontend user interface through axios.
