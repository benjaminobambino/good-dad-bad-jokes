Users will be able to launch and immediately enjoy jokes being pulled from the backend database. Users who sign up will be able to \"like\" their favorite jokes, see the jokes they've \"liked,\" and contribute their own jokes to the database. #### Jokes and user info will be stored in the backend database and updated through the frontend user interface through axios. *** ### ***Technologies Used*** * MongoDB   * Mongoose * Express * React * Node * CSS   * Flexbox *** ### ***Getting Started*** #### A Trello board is being used to keep track of development progress. It can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/VXInuKS4/good-dad-bad-jokes). #### The project will be deployed and able to be viewed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). #### Once launched, create a user account to add your own jokes, like jokes, and flag jokes. Otherwise, just open the app and enjoy the jokes! *** ### ***Screenshots*** #### Entity Relationship Diagram ![Entity Relationship Diagram](diagrams/erd.drawio.png) #### Component Hierarchy Diagram ![Component Hierarchy Diagram](diagrams/component-hierarchy-diagram.drawio.png) <!-- #### Rules Page ![Rules Page](images/readme-pics/rules-page.png) --> *** ### ***Future Updates*** - [ ] Add user's liked jokes component - [ ] Add joke flagging functionality - [ ] Add functionality to minimize or eliminate repeated jokes - [ ] Add joke search feature - [ ] Add user's contributed jokes component - [ ] Mobile-friendly design - [ ] Add joke categories *** ### ***Credits***",
